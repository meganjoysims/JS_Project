Javascript project readme file

Why are we doing this?
In order to round up our learning of javascript/html/css from academy and show off what
we're now able to achieve 

How I expected the challenge to go.
I knew there would be some aspects of the challenge which I needed to research and look into
further into in order to be able to implement some of the requirements. For example I 
expected the edit/delete functions would take more time than the add and filter functions.
Overall I expected I would be able to work through any difficulties and complete the challenge
to the specification

What went well?
I realised I was able to remember and implement things I had learnt in academy and felt comfortable with 
a lot of the project and what needed to be done. I really enjoyed being able to recognise
and use what I'd learnt before in my own project.

What didn't go as planned?
I was struggling for a short while with my update record function as when I pressed 'update',
I found that the contents of the row were being deleted instead of updated.Eventually I found it 
was becasue I had given the tags the same ID as tags further down the code. This did result in some time
wasted but was worthwhile as it improved my knowledge and gives me something to look
out for in the futre

Possible improvements for future
If I had more time for the project I would like to make the page a little more responsive, 
adding in more CSS and improving the look of the page. For example, I'd like the page to 
react when some elements are hovered over and to make the page look generally more pleasing.
